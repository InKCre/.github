# Development(Coding)  

## What does it do?

Development takes responsibility for implementing the product \
 —— **executing the product release roadmap**.

For an open-source project, there's no doubt the development should be transparent and open to everyone, so we host our code on GitHub and build our community and organization on GitHub as well.

## Topics

We can view development from these two perspectives: \
**The first** is about collaboration, handling the relationship between contributors, and the relationship between contributors and code. \
**The second**is about code itself, easy to maintain, extent, reuse, etc.
