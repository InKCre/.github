# Operation  

Besides [development](../development/index.md), this is the most important activity our organization will do. 

**What is Operation?** \
Everything after development, affecting an organization's property(product, our efforts) will be under the Operation.

For instances, \
Software license, business contract, support, finance, etc.

## Ecosystem

> Currently, ecosystem are under operation due to our tiny scale.

**What is Ecosystem?** \
In a word, subjects outside our organization contributing to [a shared vision](../about/mission.md) form an ecosystem. 

Usually, these subjects are developers, users, and variants of our products... \
In this ecosystem, our organization takes the position of orchestrating.

**We expect this ecosystem to achieve our vision together.**
