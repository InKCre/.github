# Plans

Any organization should have their roadmaps or plans. \
Our plans are divied vertically and horizontally to guding our work on time and domains.

Besides, there is a kind of plan integrated time and domains. \
It's strategy and tactic.

Strategy will cover the biggest time-range and domains, guding a long term development. \
Tactic will cover a smaller one, guding a stage-level development.

See [Our Strategy](./strategy.md) \
See [Our Tactics](./tactics/index.md)
