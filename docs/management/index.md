# Management & Organizing  

In management, organizing is a part of management. \
But considering organizing forms the fundament of decision-making, planning, control, and any other thing in management, we **put extra attention on** organizing here.

## Organizing

Organizing affects an organization's sustainability the most. \
A great developed product must have a team supporting and guiding it.

Organizing should serve for these (which are functions of management):

1. decision-making
2. planning
3. control ([development](../development/index.md))
4. execute (implementing features, maintaining, providing support): most will be covered in other aspects of this strategy.

Organizing can be divided into static one and dynamic one. \
**Static organizing** focuses on the structure of an organization while **dynamic organizing** focuses on collaboration.

### Static Organizing

There is something different between us and business organizations such as enterprises.\
——We are more likely to [DAO](./what-is-DAO.md). \
**However**, DAO won't be something we can apply right now. \
We will still keep the traditional form of organization in a not short period.

Initially, it's expected to be a loose community and later grow into a hybrid open-source organization.

### Dynamic Organizing

**Project Management**: GitHub Projects, Issues

**Knowledge Management**: VitePress + GitHub Pages

**Communication**: Telegram, Social Medias

## Other things in management

1. decision-making: need a SOP, define when, what, where, how
2. planning: need a SOP, define when, what, where, how
3. control: ?

Community governance: decision-making and planning \
Open communication: forums, meetings, events
