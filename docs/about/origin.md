To answer this question, there's a story...

## The Story

I have been suffering from a quantity of information such as videos, news, and articles that I need to read.

The first problem is the shortage of time. \
Second, while some of them have attractive titles, the content is totally trash or useless to me. \
After I spent time screening and reading, there's still a need to consume extra time taking notes, organizing... \
Not ended yet, I doubt whether I can make full use of them when I need them.

**In a word**, it's time-consuming and strenuous work to obtain, filter, dig, and use endless information.

**And**, Nowadays, most of us, especially knowledge workers confront similar problems every day. \
Products like Notion, Evernote, etc have had a surge these years can prove this.

## There's a solution?

Well, you might ask why don't I use Omnivore, Readwise, or something like that. \
—— The answer is, I had, but they can't.

For Readwise, I'm not supposed to give a judge cause I give it up before starting due to its charge.

As for Omnivore, I've been used for 3 months and more. \
It's great, but not enough for me.

**Basically**, I want these features:

1. automatically obtain information from sources
2. these sources vary from web pages, video platforms, podcasts, and email(newsletter) to private knowledge communities (DeDao App, WeChat Official Account, WeChat Subscriptions) ... etc.
3. assist me screen(toss, skim) valuable information
4. assist me read them more efficient
5. saving time, better understanding
6. taking notes, extracting knowledge
7. allow me to easily take notes and connect them
8. to make knowledge grow

**Furthermore**, I hope it can archive these too:

1. store information, and knowledge in one place
2. search, find them when I need it
    - working on sth. that needs guidance
    - need an inspiration
    - working on sth. that a tool or technique can help it better, faster
    - working on sth. that needs reports, news, and proof, such as making decisions
    - writing that needs some words, sentences, stories
3. let knowledge grow in my mind and finally form wisdom
4. export to give a presentation or publishing

——so that information(input) can be put into production, creation(output)

**Currently**, I'm struggling with below problems from the current system:

1. only articles can be read in one place —— video, audio, etc. are not supported
2. no one can assist me in screening or reading them, there is just too much information
3. I can't/hardly find what I want when I need them

## That's why

So an idea to develop software to solve all these came to me. \
Besides, considering these problems are general, I decided to make it a product. \
One step more, a product requires continuous development and a compatible ecosystem. \
That's why I am here to create an organization on GitHub (the most popular open-source platform today)
—— to build a product and community.
